# Guidelines for Project 2

Tell a story with your data!

This document contains the schedule and requirements for Project 2.

## Specific Requirements

1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
2. Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
    - A custom "creative" D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
    - A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
    - A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
    - A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
4. Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

## Weekly Schedule

Day 1 (July 15th):
Between now and Saturday, you will need to start brainstorming topics with your group and researching potential data sets. Your focus should center around:
  - Selecting a topic
  - Finding a data set
  - Finding inspiration
  - "Sketching" your ideal visuals
  - Creating a 1-page proposal

Day 2 (July 17th):
You will need to create a 1-page proposal that includes:
  - A brief articulation of your chosen topic and rationale
  - A link to your data set(s) and a screenshot of the metadata if it exists
  - 3 or 4 screenshots of relevant, "inspiring" visualizations that frame your creative fodder
  - A sketch of the final design
  - A link to the primary GitHub repository you'll be housing your work in
